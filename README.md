# Fluid_Dynamics_notes
(currently being updated)

My graduate fluid mechanics course was rich in analytical techniques useful in theoretical work and physical ideas needed to develop a 'feel' of the subject. This repository skims some froth from over the ocean. Several locations require figures for a more cogent explanation. Maybe in due course of time...

Lecture 15 - Kinematics: Local Linear Flows

Velocity gradient tensor. 
Classification of linear flows.
Linear flow in Turbulence - flow below Kolmogorov length scale.

Lecture 21 - Kinematics: Surface gravity waves

Streamlines and streaklines in comoving frame and lab frame of reference. 
Perturbation expansion to obtain the Stokes drift.
