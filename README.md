# Fluid_Dynamics_notes
(currently being updated)

Notes from a graduate course in Fluid Mechanics. There are several instances where a cogent explanation is lacking, not least due to a complete absence of diagrams. Hopefully, these issues will be resolved over time.

Lecture 15 - Kinematics: Local Linear Flows

Velocity gradient tensor. 
Classification of linear flows. 
Linear flow in Turbulence - flow below Kolmogorov length scale. 

Lecture 21 - Kinematics: Surface gravity waves

Streamlines and streaklines in comoving frame and lab frame of reference. 
Perturbation expansion to obtain the Stokes drift.

Lecture 22 - Conservation of mass and the streamfunction

Mass conservation and consideration of incompressiblity.
2D Streamfunction in polar and general orthogonal system.
Stokes streamfunction in spherical coordinate system.

Lecture 23 - Velocity field from dilation and vorticity fields

Multipole expansion.
Biot-Savart Law.
