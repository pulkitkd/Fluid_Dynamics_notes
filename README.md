# Fluid_Dynamics_notes
(currently being updated)

My graduate fluid mechanics course was inundated with physical ideas, intuition and analytical techniques useful in theoretical work. This repository skims some froth from over the ocean. Several locations require figures for a more cogent explanation. Maybe in due course of time...


Lecture 21 - Kinematics: Surface gravity waves
Streamlines and streaklines in comoving frame and lab frame of reference
Perturbation expansion to obtain the Stokes drift
